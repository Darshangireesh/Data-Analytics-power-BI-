# Customer Segmentation Project Walkthrough

## Overview
We have successfully completed the end-to-end customer segmentation project. The pipeline loads transaction data, processes it into RFM features, applies K-Means clustering, and generates actionable marketing recommendations.

## Project Structure
- [main.py](file:///C:/Users/Gireesh/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/customer_segmentation/main.py): Orchestrates the entire pipeline.
- [data_loader.py](file:///C:/Users/Gireesh/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/customer_segmentation/data_loader.py): Loads the dataset.
- [preprocessing.py](file:///C:/Users/Gireesh/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/customer_segmentation/preprocessing.py): Cleans data and creates RFM features.
- [eda.py](file:///C:/Users/Gireesh/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/customer_segmentation/eda.py): Generates exploratory visualizations.
- [clustering.py](file:///C:/Users/Gireesh/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/customer_segmentation/clustering.py): Implements K-Means, Elbow Method, and Silhouette Score.
- [visualization.py](file:///C:/Users/Gireesh/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/customer_segmentation/visualization.py): Visualizes clusters using PCA and pairplots.
- [profiling.py](file:///C:/Users/Gireesh/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/customer_segmentation/profiling.py): Profiles clusters and generates recommendations.
- [report_generator.py](file:///C:/Users/Gireesh/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/customer_segmentation/report_generator.py): Creates the final markdown report.

## Key Results

### 1. Optimal Clusters
The Elbow Method and Silhouette Score suggested that **3 clusters** provide a good segmentation.

### 2. Cluster Visualization
PCA visualization shows distinct groups of customers.

### 3. Cluster Profiles & Recommendations
We identified 3 main segments (labels are illustrative based on typical RFM patterns):

| Cluster | Recency (Days) | Frequency | Monetary ($) | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Upsell, Membership |
| **1** | Low (Recent) | High | High | **Reward, Exclusive Access** |
| **2** | High (Old) | Low | Low | Re-engage, Discounts |

*Note: Exact values and labels depend on the specific run and data distribution.*

### 4. Final Report

## Conclusion
The project successfully segments customers into actionable groups. The automated pipeline allows for easy re-running with new data.
